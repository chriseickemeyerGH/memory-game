# Memory Game (Concentration)
### Rules
The player chooses two cards and turns them face up. If they are of the same rank and color or if cards match under some other determined conditions, then that pair is removed and the user picks again. If the cards do not match, they are turned face down again and the player chooses two cards again. The game ends when the last pair has been picked up.
